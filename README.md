# Demand Prediction Application

 **a Prototype model to predict the demands**
 
 Surprised with Saudi Arabia's win over Argentina in FIFA-2022? and so goes with the demands across supply chain - these  are surprising & unpredictable at times .

In this next use case of **#SCMUnfolds** , I have created a web based prototype application using some machine learning techniques to predict the demands in future.

This prototype model accepts the data in TimeSeries & predicts the demand based on historical data patterns.

**Here is the homescreen screenshot **:

You can choose from 4 various forecasting models to predict the demand , choose anyone from them .

Enter the forecast horizon by using the slider & click on 'click here to start prediction with our sample dataset'

Result will be as followed : It will have forecasted values & model accuracy

You can even upload a csv file in prescribed format - first column titled as date & having date values & next column to have values to be predicted labeled under column name as 'Total'

Once file is uploaded choose the model from the list to predict the results . Output would look as follows :
